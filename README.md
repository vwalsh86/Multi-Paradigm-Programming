# Multi-Paradigm-Programming
Coursework I have completed as apart of this module for my GMIT studies for H. Dip in Data Analytics

As apart of this course, I undertook a project where I needed to complete tasks in the languages of Python and C.

With the module being Multi-Paradigm Programming, I reproduced the task in the Python language in the form of Object Orientated Programming and Procedural Programming.

<h3> Procedural Programming: </h3>
<ol>
  <li> Python </li>
  <li> C </li>
</ol>

<h3> Object-Orientated Programming: </h3>
<ol>
  <li> Python </li>
</ol>
